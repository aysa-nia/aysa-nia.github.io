## Rats laugh when tickled
A study was conducted at the University of Berlin to explore what happens in the human brain when we are tickled.
National Geographic wrote that the testing on rats showed that they, in fact, love to be tickled, especially on their backs
When tickled, rats let out an extremely high-pitched sound, associated with laughing. 
They even search for the experimenter's hand when they stop and ask for more!
