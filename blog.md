## 1.Rats laugh when tickled
A study was conducted at the University of Berlin to explore what happens in the human brain when we are tickled. National Geographic wrote that the testing on rats showed that they, in fact, love to be tickled, especially on their backs. When tickled, rats let out an extremely high-pitched sound, associated with laughing. They even search for the experimenter's hand when they stop and ask for more!

They may be small, but they play a key role in our environment in ways you wouldn't imagine. These little furry friends plant thousands of trees every year, worldwide, due to simply forgetting where they buried their acorns. How cute!
